# Getting Started with Weather App

This project was created to display weather cards using data from [Open weather map API](https://openweathermap.org/).
In this simgle page app you are able to check out you current locatiom weather, but you can also search for another city and save this new city in a list of cards.

But first you need to follow the steps below:

### Clone repository

Clone the repository by running the following command:

```sh
# With SSH.
git@github.com:gusmagnago/weatherapp.git

# Or with HTTPS.
https://github.com/gusmagnago/weatherapp.git
```

### Requirements

- Node version: `16`

### Install dependencies

Once you've cloned the repository install the required dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

### Setup .env

Before running the project you need to create a `.env` file in the root of the
repository. You can copy the file `.env.sample` and rename it to
`.env`.

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

`change the values`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
